# Personal Website

> Sharing learnings and insights from my journey with Design Systems and React DevTools.

## 🚀 About This Project

This is my personal website where I document what I'm learning and building in React development, particularly around Design Systems and React DevTools. After 5+ years working with React, I've found these areas fascinating and want to share the discoveries, challenges, and solutions I encounter along the way.

## 🎯 Focus Areas

- **Design Systems**: Scalable component architectures, design tokens, and systematic approaches to UI consistency
- **React DevTools**: Advanced debugging techniques, performance optimization, and developer experience enhancement
- **React Engineering**: Patterns and concepts I've found useful in day-to-day work

## 📝 Content Strategy

### Blog Categories

- **Design Systems Deep Dives**: What I'm learning about component API design, theming, and scaling challenges
- **React DevTools Insights**: Debugging techniques and performance analysis that have helped me
