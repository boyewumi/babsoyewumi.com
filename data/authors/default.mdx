I'm a React engineer with 5+ years of experience building user interfaces. I've become fascinated by the intersection of Design Systems and React DevTools, and I'm diving deeper into understanding how systematic thinking can improve development workflows.

My curiosity about how great teams scale their UI development has led me to start exploring component API design, design tokens, and the tooling that makes complex React applications maintainable. I'm particularly interested in learning how React DevTools can reveal insights that aren't obvious from just reading code.

This site is where I document what I'm discovering, the challenges I'm working through, and the solutions I'm experimenting with. I'm planning to contribute more to open source projects and engage with the developer community as I build expertise in these areas.

I believe the most valuable insights come from real problems, so I focus on sharing what I'm actually learning from hands-on experience rather than just theoretical knowledge.
