I'm building a React UI library from scratch to deeply understand scalable, accessible component systems. This is part of a learning-in-public series where I share what works, what breaks, and what I learn from each step.

## Preview

</div>

A week ago, I shared my plans to build a React UI component library from scratch. I thought I'd start with the most basic component possible: a button. How hard could it be?

**Turns out, there's nothing simple about a truly good button component.** Here's what I discovered in my first week of actual development.

## The Foundation: Design Tokens That Actually Work

Before I could build any components, I needed to establish my design system foundation. I chose **Tailwind CSS v4's new `@theme` syntax**, which lets me define custom design tokens directly in CSS:

```css
@theme {
  --color-primary-500: #3a30e8;
  --color-neutral-100: #e1e3e6;
  --font-size-body: 0.875rem;
  --radius-md: 0.5rem;
  --shadow-primary-sm: 0 4px 6px -1px rgb(58 48 232 / 0.1);
}
```

This approach gives me complete control over my design tokens while still leveraging Tailwind's utility classes. I can reference these tokens directly in my components as `bg-primary-500` or `text-body`, creating a consistent design language from day one.

I also built a comprehensive typography system based on research from 44+ design systems, organizing everything into four hierarchical levels:

- **Display** — For hero sections and major headings
- **Heading** — For section titles and content hierarchy
- **Body** — For main content and descriptions
- **Label** — For UI elements and form labels

This structure handles most UI needs without overwhelming developers with too many choices.

## The Button That Taught Me Everything

Starting with a button seemed like the obvious choice—it's fundamental, widely used, and conceptually simple. But as I dove deeper, I realized that **a production-ready button component touches nearly every aspect of a design system**.

### Accessibility From the Ground Up

Rather than bolting on accessibility as an afterthought, I decided to use [React Aria](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/) as my foundation. This library handles the complex accessibility patterns that are easy to get wrong:

```tsx
import { useButton } from 'react-aria'
import { forwardRef } from 'react'

const Button = forwardRef<HTMLButtonElement, ButtonProps>((props, ref) => {
  const { buttonProps } = useButton(props, ref)

  return (
    <button {...buttonProps} ref={ref}>
      {props.children}
    </button>
  )
})
```

React Aria automatically handles keyboard navigation, focus management, screen reader compatibility, and cross-platform press events. It's like having an accessibility expert built into every component.

### The API Design Challenge

Designing the component's API proved more complex than I expected. I had to balance flexibility with simplicity:

```ts
export interface ButtonProps
  extends Pick<AriaButtonProps, 'onPress' | 'isDisabled' | 'aria-label' | 'aria-describedby'> {
  children?: React.ReactNode
  variant?: 'primary' | 'secondary' | 'outline'
  size?: 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg'
  className?: string
}
```

The key insight was using TypeScript's `Pick` utility to selectively expose React Aria props rather than the entire interface. This gives users access to essential accessibility features while keeping the API manageable.

### Styling Architecture: CVA for the Win

For styling, I discovered [Class Variance Authority (CVA)](https://cva.style/), which provides a clean way to handle component variants:

```ts
const buttonVariants = cva(
  'inline-flex items-center justify-center rounded font-medium transition-colors',
  {
    variants: {
      variant: {
        primary: 'bg-primary-500 text-white hover:bg-primary-600',
        secondary: 'bg-neutral-100 text-neutral-900 hover:bg-neutral-200',
        outline: 'border border-neutral-200 bg-transparent hover:bg-neutral-50',
      },
      size: {
        sm: 'h-8 px-3 text-label',
        md: 'h-9 px-4 text-label-lg',
        lg: 'h-10 px-6 text-body-md',
      },
    },
    defaultVariants: {
      variant: 'primary',
      size: 'md',
    },
  }
)
```

CVA perfectly bridges the gap between type safety and flexible styling, giving me excellent TypeScript support while keeping the component code clean.

### The Polymorphic Button Problem

Just when I thought I was done, I realized I needed link functionality. Users should be able to pass an `href` prop and get a link that looks exactly like a button. This led me into the world of **polymorphic components**:

```tsx
const Button = forwardRef<HTMLButtonElement, ButtonProps>((props, ref) => {
  if (props.href) {
    return (
      <Link href={props.href} target={props.target}>
        <button {...buttonProps} ref={ref}>
          {props.children}
        </button>
      </Link>
    )
  }

  return (
    <button {...buttonProps} ref={ref}>
      {props.children}
    </button>
  )
})
```

This pattern lets users write `<Button href="/about">About</Button>` and get proper link semantics with button styling—exactly what they expect.

## What Surprised Me

**TypeScript is more helpful than I expected** — Using utility types like `Pick` and proper interface design caught so many potential issues early. The initial setup time pays dividends throughout development.

**Accessibility complexity is front-loaded** — React Aria handles the hard parts upfront, but you need to understand the patterns. Once you do, future components become much easier.

**Design tokens need real usage to validate** — My typography system looked great on paper, but actually implementing it in the button revealed gaps and inconsistencies that needed addressing.

**Component architecture decisions compound** — Early choices about `forwardRef`, prop naming, and variant patterns will influence every future component. Getting the foundation right is crucial.

## The Learning Continues

Building one button component taught me more about design systems than months of reading about them. I now have a solid foundation for the components that follow:

- **Proven accessibility strategy** with React Aria
- **Flexible styling architecture** with CVA and Tailwind
- **Design tokens** that actually work in practice
- **TypeScript patterns** for maintainable APIs

Next up, I'm tackling **form inputs and modals**—components that will test different aspects of this foundation. Each one will teach me something new about the intersection of design, development, and user experience.

The goal isn't to build the next big UI library. It's to understand every decision that goes into scalable component architecture. One component at a time.
