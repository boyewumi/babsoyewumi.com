I recently launched my personal website and decided to build my own React UI component library alongside it. This is a space for me to experiment, grow, and apply everything I've been learning about frontend development, design systems, and component architecture.

## The Why Behind This Project

Creating my own library isn't about reinventing the wheel—it's about **understanding the mechanics of the wheel**. I want to dive deep into the theming, accessibility, reusability, and design consistency that makes scalable UI systems work.

This project gives me the chance to:

**Learn by doing** — Apply patterns I've used professionally in a controlled environment where I can experiment freely

**Build thoughtfully** — Create reusable components from scratch with proper documentation and clear APIs

**Improve my workflow** — Develop better tooling, structure, and developer experience for my own projects

## Progress So Far

**Foundation Complete**

- Personal site is live and deployed on Vercel
- UI library scaffolded with Vite and TypeScript
- Clean project architecture with `@` path aliases
- Clear separation: main site consumes library as dependency

The groundwork is solid, which means I can focus on the interesting parts—the actual components and design system.

## What's Coming Next

**Core Development**

- Building essential components (Button, Card, Input, Modal)
- Implementing design tokens and comprehensive theme support
- Setting up Storybook for component documentation

**Quality & Testing**

- Adding test coverage with Vitest/Testing Library
- Exploring visual regression testing
- Preparing build pipeline for potential npm packaging

## My Philosophy on This

I'm not trying to compete with MUI, Radix, or any established library. This isn't about building for external users—**it's personal**. It's optimized for my workflows, my learning, and my clarity of thought.

The goal is shipping and learning in public. If it eventually becomes something worth open-sourcing or sharing more broadly, that's a bonus. But right now, it's just me building something I understand completely.
